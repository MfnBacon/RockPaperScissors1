# RockPaperScissors

Assignment for The Odin Project.
I knew exactly how to handle the computerPlay random select right away, glad to see I had the general idea in the beginning.

Unexpectedly had issues with how to put things in the correct order, and kept getting errors because I had called variables in the wrong spot.
Slow progress, probably needs a lot of work so I welcome any and all feedback. Thanks!
